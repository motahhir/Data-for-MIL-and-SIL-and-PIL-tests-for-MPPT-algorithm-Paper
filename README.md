This work develops a modified Maximum Power Point Tracking controller as the automotive and aeronautical applications are developed. According to ISO26262 and DO-178C respectively. Therefore, the V-cycle development process has been followed (Figure 1). That means that our controller will be validated using Model in the loop/Software in the loop/ Processor in the loop tests. Hence, this works can be used as a reference to integrate the photovoltaic energy in automotive or aeronautical fields. In addition, Processor in the loop test presented in this work can be used as a low-cost solution to test the hardware implementation of MPPT algorithms.
